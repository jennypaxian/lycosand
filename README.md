<p><strong>Lycosand</strong> is a decentralized and federated social networking service, implementing the <strong>Lysand/ActivityPub</strong> standard.<br>
It is a soft-fork from Iceshrimp, with the main goal to implement the Lysand federation protocol while maintaining support for ActivityPub and achieving feature-parity with commom fediverse stacks.
